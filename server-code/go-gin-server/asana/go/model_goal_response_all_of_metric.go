type GoalResponseAllOfMetric struct {

	// Globally unique identifier of the resource, as a string.
	Gid string `json:"gid,omitempty"`

	// The base type of this resource.
	ResourceType string `json:"resource_type,omitempty"`

	// ISO 4217 currency code to format this custom field. This will be null if the `unit` is not `currency`.
	CurrencyCode *string `json:"currency_code,omitempty"`

	// This string is the current value of a goal metric of type string.
	CurrentDisplayValue string `json:"current_display_value,omitempty"`

	// This number is the current value of a goal metric of type number.
	CurrentNumberValue float32 `json:"current_number_value,omitempty"`

	// This number is the start value of a goal metric of type number.
	InitialNumberValue float32 `json:"initial_number_value,omitempty"`

	// *Conditional*. Only relevant for goal metrics of type ‘Number’. This field dictates the number of places after the decimal to round to, i.e. 0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so on. Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive. For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of 0.25 has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision of 1. This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%.
	Precision int32 `json:"precision,omitempty"`

	// This field defines how the progress value of a goal metric is being calculated. A goal's progress can be provided manually by the user, calculated automatically from contributing subgoals or projects, or managed by an integration with an external data source, such as Salesforce.
	ProgressSource string `json:"progress_source,omitempty"`

	// The subtype of this resource. Different subtypes retain many of the same fields and behavior, but may render differently in Asana or represent resources with different semantic meaning.
	ResourceSubtype string `json:"resource_subtype,omitempty"`

	// This number is the end value of a goal metric of type number. This number cannot equal `initial_number_value`.
	TargetNumberValue float32 `json:"target_number_value,omitempty"`

	// A supported unit of measure for the goal metric, or none.
	Unit string `json:"unit,omitempty"`

	// *Conditional*. Only relevant for `progress_source` of type `external`. This boolean indicates whether the requester has the ability to update the current value of this metric. This returns `true` if the external metric was created by the requester, `false` otherwise.
	CanManage bool `json:"can_manage,omitempty"`
