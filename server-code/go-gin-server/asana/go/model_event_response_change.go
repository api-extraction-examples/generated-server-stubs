// EventResponseChange - Information about the type of change that has occurred. This field is only present when the value of the property `action`, describing the action taken on the **resource**, is `changed`.
type EventResponseChange struct {

	// The type of action taken on the **field** which has been changed.  This can be one of `changed`, `added`, or `removed` depending on the nature of the change.
	Action string `json:"action,omitempty"`

	// *Conditional.* This property is only present when the **field's** `action` is `added` _and_ the `added_value` is an Asana resource. This will be only the `gid` and `resource_type` of the resource when the events come from webhooks; this will be the compact representation (and can have fields expanded with [opt_fields](/docs/input-output-options)) when using the [Events](/docs/asana-events) endpoint.
	AddedValue *interface{} `json:"added_value,omitempty"`

	// The name of the field that has changed in the resource.
	Field string `json:"field,omitempty"`

	// *Conditional.* This property is only present when the **field's** `action` is `changed` _and_ the `new_value` is an Asana resource. This will be only the `gid` and `resource_type` of the resource when the events come from webhooks; this will be the compact representation (and can have fields expanded with [opt_fields](/docs/input-output-options)) when using the [Events](/docs/asana-events) endpoint.
	NewValue *interface{} `json:"new_value,omitempty"`

	// *Conditional.* This property is only present when the **field's** `action` is `removed` _and_ the `removed_value` is an Asana resource. This will be only the `gid` and `resource_type` of the resource when the events come from webhooks; this will be the compact representation (and can have fields expanded with [opt_fields](/docs/input-output-options)) when using the [Events](/docs/asana-events) endpoint.
	RemovedValue *interface{} `json:"removed_value,omitempty"`
