	// Name of the task. This is generally a short sentence fragment that fits on a line in the UI for maximum readability. However, it can be longer.

	// The subtype of this resource. Different subtypes retain many of the same fields and behavior, but may render differently in Asana or represent resources with different semantic meaning. The resource_subtype `milestone` represent a single moment in time. This means tasks with this subtype cannot have a start_date.

	ActualTimeMinutes *float32 `json:"actual_time_minutes,omitempty"`

	// *Conditional* Reflects the approval status of this task. This field is kept in sync with `completed`, meaning `pending` translates to false while `approved`, `rejected`, and `changes_requested` translate to true. If you set completed to true, this field will be set to `approved`.
	ApprovalStatus string `json:"approval_status,omitempty"`

	// *Deprecated* Scheduling status of this task for the user it is assigned to. This field can only be set if the assignee is non-null. Setting this field to \"inbox\" or \"upcoming\" inserts it at the top of the section, while the other options will insert at the bottom.

	DueAt *string `json:"due_at,omitempty"`

	// The localized date on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due date. This takes a date with `YYYY-MM-DD` format and should not be used together with `due_at`.

	HtmlNotes string `json:"html_notes,omitempty"`

	// [Opt In](/docs/input-output-options). In some contexts tasks can be rendered as a visual separator; for instance, subtasks can appear similar to [sections](/docs/asana-sections) without being true `section` objects. If a `task` object is rendered this way in any context it will have the property `is_rendered_as_separator` set to `true`.

	// The *assignee section* is a subdivision of a project that groups tasks together in the assignee's \"My Tasks\" list. It can either be a header above a list of tasks in a list view or a column in a board view of \"My Tasks.\" The `assignee_section` property will be returned in the response only if the request was sent by the user who is the assignee of the task.
