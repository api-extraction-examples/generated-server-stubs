	ResourceType string `json:"resource_type,omitempty"`

	// Name of the task. This is generally a short sentence fragment that fits on a line in the UI for maximum readability. However, it can be longer.

	// The subtype of this resource. Different subtypes retain many of the same fields and behavior, but may render differently in Asana or represent resources with different semantic meaning. The resource_subtype `milestone` represent a single moment in time. This means tasks with this subtype cannot have a start_date.

	// *Conditional* Reflects the approval status of this task. This field is kept in sync with `completed`, meaning `pending` translates to false while `approved`, `rejected`, and `changes_requested` translate to true. If you set completed to true, this field will be set to `approved`.
	ApprovalStatus string `json:"approval_status,omitempty"`

	// *Deprecated* Scheduling status of this task for the user it is assigned to. This field can only be set if the assignee is non-null. Setting this field to \"inbox\" or \"upcoming\" inserts it at the top of the section, while the other options will insert at the bottom.

	DueAt *string `json:"due_at,omitempty"`

	// The localized date on which this task is due, or null if the task has no due date. This takes a date with `YYYY-MM-DD` format and should not be used together with `due_at`.

	// [Opt In](/docs/input-output-options). In some contexts tasks can be rendered as a visual separator; for instance, subtasks can appear similar to [sections](/docs/asana-sections) without being true `section` objects.

	StartAt *string `json:"start_at,omitempty"`

	// The day on which work begins for the task , or null if the task has no start date. This takes a date with `YYYY-MM-DD` format and should not be used together with `start_at`. *Note: `due_on` or `due_at` must be present in the request when setting or unsetting the `start_on` parameter.*

For example, these custom field values will contain an `enum_value` property for custom fields of type `enum`, a `text_value` property for custom fields of type `text`, and so on. Please note that the `gid` returned on each custom field value *is identical* to the `gid` of the custom field, which allows referencing the custom field metadata through the `/custom_fields/custom_field-gid` endpoint.
