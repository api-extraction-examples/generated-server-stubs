	// This container is returned to show the payment methods that are accepted for the payment business policy.  <br><br>Sellers do not have to specify any electronic payment methods for listings, so this array will often be returned empty unless the payment business policy is intended for motor vehicle listings or other items in categories where offline payments are required or supported.
