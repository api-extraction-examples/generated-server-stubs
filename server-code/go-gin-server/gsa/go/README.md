### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
