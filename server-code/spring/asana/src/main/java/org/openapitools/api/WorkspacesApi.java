An *organization* is a special kind of workspace that represents a company. In an organization, you can group your projects into teams. You can read more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide. To tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its `is_organization` property.  Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and to release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually deprecate using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and until after some reasonable grace period following any further announcements, you can still reference organizations in any `workspace` parameter.")

     * To mirror the functionality of the Asana web app&#39;s advanced search feature, the Asana API has a task search endpoint that allows you to build complex filters to find and retrieve the exact data you need. #### Premium access Like the Asana web product&#39;s advance search feature, this search endpoint will only be available to premium Asana users. A user is premium if any of the following is true:  - The workspace in which the search is being performed is a premium workspace - The user is a member of a premium team inside the workspace  Even if a user is only a member of a premium team inside a non-premium workspace, search will allow them to find data anywhere in the workspace, not just inside the premium team. Making a search request using credentials of a non-premium user will result in a &#x60;402 Payment Required&#x60; error. #### Pagination Search results are not stable; repeating the same query multiple times may return the data in a different order, even if the data do not change. Because of this, the traditional [pagination](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#pagination) available elsewhere in the Asana API is not available here. However, you can paginate manually by sorting the search results by their creation time and then modifying each subsequent query to exclude data you have already seen. Page sizes are limited to a maximum of 100 items, and can be specified by the &#x60;limit&#x60; query parameter. #### Eventual consistency Changes in Asana (regardless of whether they’re made though the web product or the API) are forwarded to our search infrastructure to be indexed. This process can take between 10 and 60 seconds to complete under normal operation, and longer during some production incidents. Making a change to a task that would alter its presence in a particular search query will not be reflected immediately. This is also true of the advanced search feature in the web product. #### Rate limits You may receive a &#x60;429 Too Many Requests&#x60; response if you hit any of our [rate limits](https://developers.asana.com/docs/#rate-limits). #### Custom field parameters | Parameter name | Custom field type | Accepted type | |---|---|---| | custom_fields.{gid}.is_set | All | Boolean | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Text | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Number | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.value | Enum | Enum option ID | | custom_fields.{gid}.starts_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.ends_with | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.contains | Text only | String | | custom_fields.{gid}.less_than | Number only | Number | | custom_fields.{gid}.greater_than | Number only | Number |   For example, if the gid of the custom field is 12345, these query parameter to find tasks where it is set would be &#x60;custom_fields.12345.is_set&#x3D;true&#x60;. To match an exact value for an enum custom field, use the gid of the desired enum option and not the name of the enum option: &#x60;custom_fields.12345.value&#x3D;67890&#x60;.  **Not Supported**: searching for multiple exact matches of a custom field, searching for multi-enum custom field  *Note: If you specify &#x60;projects.any&#x60; and &#x60;sections.any&#x60;, you will receive tasks for the project **and** tasks for the section. If you&#39;re looking for only tasks in a section, omit the &#x60;projects.any&#x60; from the request.*

     * GET /workspaces/{workspace_gid}/typeahead : Get objects via typeahead
     * Retrieves objects in the workspace based via an auto-completion/typeahead search algorithm. This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so you won’t be able to fetch large numbers of results.  The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and cannot be paginated.  Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what data is included in a response.  Resources with type &#x60;user&#x60; are returned in order of most contacted to least contacted. This is determined by task assignments, adding the user to projects, and adding the user as a follower to tasks, messages, etc.  Resources with type &#x60;project&#x60; are returned in order of recency. This is determined when the user visits the project, is added to the project, and completes tasks in the project.  Resources with type &#x60;task&#x60; are returned with priority placed on tasks the user is following, but no guarantee on the order of those tasks.  Resources with type &#x60;project_template&#x60; are returned with priority placed on favorited project templates.  Leaving the &#x60;query&#x60; string empty or omitted will give you results, still following the resource ordering above. This could be used to list users or projects that are relevant for the requesting user&#39;s api token.
     *
     * @param workspaceGid Globally unique identifier for the workspace or organization. (required)
     * @param resourceType The type of values the typeahead should return. You can choose from one of the following: &#x60;custom_field&#x60;, &#x60;project&#x60;, &#x60;project_template&#x60;, &#x60;portfolio&#x60;, &#x60;tag&#x60;, &#x60;task&#x60;, and &#x60;user&#x60;. Note that unlike in the names of endpoints, the types listed here are in singular form (e.g. &#x60;task&#x60;). Using multiple types is not yet supported. (required)
     * @param type *Deprecated: new integrations should prefer the resource_type field.* (optional, default to user)
     * @param query The string that will be used to search for relevant objects. If an empty string is passed in, the API will return results. (optional)
     * @param count The number of results to return. The default is 20 if this parameter is omitted, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 100. If there are fewer results found than requested, all will be returned. (optional)
     * @param optPretty Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
     * @param optFields Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. (optional)
     * @return Successfully retrieved objects via a typeahead search algorithm. (status code 200)
     *         or This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again. (status code 400)
     *         or A valid authentication token was not provided with the request, so the API could not associate a user with the request. (status code 401)
     *         or The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. (status code 403)
     *         or Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist. (status code 404)
     *         or There was a problem on Asana’s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase. (status code 500)
