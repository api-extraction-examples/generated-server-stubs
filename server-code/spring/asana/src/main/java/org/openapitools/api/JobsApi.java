@Tag(name = "Jobs", description = "Jobs represent processes that handle asynchronous work. A job created when an endpoint requests an action that will be handled asynchronously, such as project or task duplication.  Only the creator of the duplication process can access the duplication status of the new object.  *Note*: With any work that is handled asynchronously (e.g., [project instantation from a template](/docs/instantiate-a-project-from-a-project-template), duplicating a [task](/docs/duplicate-a-task) or [project](/docs/duplicate-a-project), etc.), the *intermittent states* of newly-created objects may not be consistent. That is, object properties may return different values each time when polled until the job `status` has returned a `succeeded` value.")

     * @param optPretty Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
     * @param optFields Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. (optional)
     * @return Successfully retrieved Job. (status code 200)

     *         or The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. (status code 403)
     *         or Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist. (status code 404)
     *         or There was a problem on Asana’s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase. (status code 500)
