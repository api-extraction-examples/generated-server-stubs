@Tag(name = "Tasks", description = "The task is the basic object around which many operations in Asana are centered. In the Asana application, multiple tasks populate the middle pane according to some view parameters, and the set of selected tasks determines the more detailed information presented in the details pane.  Sections are unique in that they will be included in the `memberships` field of task objects returned in the API when the task is within a section. They can also be used to manipulate the ordering of a task within a project.  [Queries](/docs/get-multiple-tasks) return a [compact representation of each task object](/docs/task-compact). To retrieve *all* fields or *specific set* of the fields, use [field selectors](/docs/input-output-options) to manipulate what data is included in a response.")

     *
     * @param userTaskListGid Globally unique identifier for the user task list. (required)
     * @param completedSince Only return tasks that are either incomplete or that have been completed since this time. Accepts a date-time string or the keyword *now*.  (optional)
     * @param optPretty Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
     * @param optFields Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. (optional)
     * @param limit Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100. (optional)
     * @param offset Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. &#39;Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.&#39; (optional)
     * @return Successfully retrieved the user task list&#39;s tasks. (status code 200)
     *         or This usually occurs because of a missing or malformed parameter. Check the documentation and the syntax of your request and try again. (status code 400)

     *         or The authentication and request syntax was valid but the server is refusing to complete the request. This can happen if you try to read or write to objects or properties that the user does not have access to. (status code 403)
     *         or Either the request method and path supplied do not specify a known action in the API, or the object specified by the request does not exist. (status code 404)
     *         or There was a problem on Asana’s end. In the event of a server error the response body should contain an error phrase. These phrases can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error. Some errors are due to server load, and will not supply an error phrase. (status code 500)
