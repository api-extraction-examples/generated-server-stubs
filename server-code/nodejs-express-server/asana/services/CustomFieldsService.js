/**
* Create a custom field
* Creates a new custom field in a workspace. Every custom field is required to be created in a specific workspace, and this workspace cannot be changed once set.  A custom field’s name must be unique within a workspace and not conflict with names of existing task properties such as `Due Date` or `Assignee`. A custom field’s type must be one of `text`, `enum`, `multi_enum`, `number`, `date`, or `people`.  Returns the full record of the newly created custom field.
*
* optUnderscorepretty Boolean Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging. (optional)
* optUnderscorefields List Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options. (optional)
* limit Integer Results per page. The number of objects to return per page. The value must be between 1 and 100. (optional)
* offset String Offset token. An offset to the next page returned by the API. A pagination request will return an offset token, which can be used as an input parameter to the next request. If an offset is not passed in, the API will return the first page of results. 'Note: You can only pass in an offset that was returned to you via a previously paginated request.' (optional)
* createCustomFieldRequest CreateCustomFieldRequest The custom field object to create. (optional)
* returns createCustomField_201_response
