/**
* Bulk set issue property
* Sets a property value on multiple issues.  The value set can be a constant or determined by a [Jira expression](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/). Expressions must be computable with constant complexity when applied to a set of issues. Expressions must also comply with the [restrictions](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-expressions/#restrictions) that apply to all Jira expressions.  The issues to be updated can be specified by a filter.  The filter identifies issues eligible for update using these criteria:   *  `entityIds` Only issues from this list are eligible.  *  `currentValue` Only issues with the property set to this value are eligible.  *  `hasProperty`:           *  If *true*, only issues with the property are eligible.      *  If *false*, only issues without the property are eligible.  If more than one criteria is specified, they are joined with the logical *AND*: only issues that satisfy all criteria are eligible.  If an invalid combination of criteria is provided, an error is returned. For example, specifying a `currentValue` and `hasProperty` as *false* would not match any issues (because without the property the property cannot have a value).  The filter is optional. Without the filter all the issues visible to the user and where the user has the EDIT\\_ISSUES permission for the issue are considered eligible.
