# Go API Server for openapi

Description of Instagram RESTful API.

Current limitations:
  * Instagram service does not support [cross origin headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS)
  for security reasons, therefore it is not possible to use Swagger UI and make API calls directly from browser.
  * Modification API requests (`POST`, `DELETE`) require additional security [scopes](https://instagram.com/developer/authorization/)
  that are available for Apps [created on or after Nov 17, 2015](http://instagram.com/developer/review/) and
  started in [Sandbox Mode](http://instagram.com/developer/sandbox/).
  * Consider the [Instagram limitations](https://instagram.com/developer/limits/) for API calls that depends on App Mode.

**Warning:** For Apps [created on or after Nov 17, 2015](http://instagram.com/developer/changelog/) API responses
containing media objects no longer return the `data` field in `comments` and `likes` nodes.
