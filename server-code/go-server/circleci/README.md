# Go API Server for openapi

The CircleCI API is a RESTful, fully-featured API that allows you to do almost anything in CircleCI.
You can access all information and trigger all actions.
The only thing we donâ€™t provide access to is billing functions, which must be done from the CircleCI web UI.


## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.
