// TimeDuration - A type used to specify a period of time using a specified time-measurement unit. Payment, return, and fulfillment business policies all use this type to specify time windows.<br/><br/>Whenever a container that uses this type is used in a request, both of these fields are required. Similarly, whenever a container that uses this type is returned in a response, both of these fields are always returned.

A span of time is defined when you apply the value specified in the <b>value</b> field to the value specified for <b>unit</b>. <br/><br/>See <b>TimeDurationUnitEnum</b> for a complete list of possible time-measurement units. For implementation help, refer to <a href='https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/sell/account/types/ba:TimeDurationUnitEnum'>eBay API documentation</a>
